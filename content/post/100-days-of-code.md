The distinction between A type and B type people is real. I know, because for most of my living memory I *have* been a B Type person. While it might have its own advantages, the danger of being afflicted with laziness or complacence is all the more. Not to mention - you can easily go down the slippery slope of depression. Which then leads to lack of physical movement ( including not leaving your now shabby room for extended lengths of time ), and that feeds into a vicious cycle of wallowing in eternal misery.

You know you are getting lazy when you internally groan at all your pending projects, and choose to start a new one over finishing the old ones. In my case, almost all my projects were thrown aside soon after they were functional. Doing projects, well I love that bit. *Documenting* them however, is a completely different story. The only way to do the last mile is to build a system that you follow out of sheer habit. That makes sure that there are enough pointers to when you are slacking - and better still if there is no leeway to slack.

Which is why, when I saw 100-days-of-code, I could *feel* the rush of dopamine. A no-nonsense approach to making sure you clock in sufficient progress each day. Better still - you can keep track of what you did when. It might seem obvious, but trust me. Any local files you might create to do something similar will meet the same fate as the 'timetables' you made as an undergraduate student to avoid last minute overnighters. Basically, they will gather dust and you won't even remember all the work you put in when you are at your most miserable, migraine afflicted shabby self in a dingy darklit messy room. Clocking in your progress on Github is awesome for three reaons.
	- Github has a super super cool name and uses the uber cool command - git. Who doesn't like to commit and push stuff? Its almost an addiction.
	- You are going to use your Github account for a long time to come, how long before you come across your 100 days of work? 
	- End result are real world projects that add to your portfolio.

The ingenuity of the project is that it converts a moment of motivation into over 3 months of disciplined slog. Makes you feel good about it. Outputs some actual, usable projects. *Can* there be anything better?
