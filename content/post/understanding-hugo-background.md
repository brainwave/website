This post explores my experiences while using [Hugo](gohugo.io), a static website generator. I found easy to get confused, even frustrated, while attempting to build my first real website. If you are like me and have never dabbled in web development before, this post is for you.


### Background
Websites that serve fixed content across users and sessions are typically *static* in nature. In contrast to dynamic websites that connect to database backends, satic websites are easier to learn, have few, if any security considerations, are faster to get up and running. For these reasons, they are often recommended for fledgeling web developers. 

If you have ever used wordpress or any other online site builder, you most probably generated a site using a *static website builder*. These builders save the trouble of writing all the HTML or CSS codes, while still acheiving great results in a short time with little or no tweaking. Thats why they are perfect for my requirement of a personal website thats easy to update and maintain.

### Why Hugo?
I was aware There are quite a few static website frameworks out there.


Static website generators strike the right balance between usability and tweakability. I have been programming for years but I just never got around to web development. The idea of delving into HTML5, CSS, javascript and what not just to realize how incompatible the whole website is quite putting off.
