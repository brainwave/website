While serving primarily as a portal to showcase my current and future [projects](/projects/index/), this website is many other things. It is also a learning exercise since its my first sincere effort at building a personal website that is minimalist yet customizable. Additionally, it is one of the two main products I am building as part of the [100-days-of-code challenge](/post/100-days-of-code/). I also find it a refreshingly effective tool for streamlining my ideas, aligning efforts with my goals. 

These days I am looking for stable employment opportunities that involve a ton of coding. Meanwhile, I am working towards updating my portfolio and consolidating my current skillset by learning something every day. I will be posting my explorations in a series of [technical articles](/tags/technical-articles/). Additionally, I will also be writing about my [experiences](/tags/experiences/) during the period. 

If you are interested, you can find my up to date Resume [here](/files/Brahm_CV.pdf) and more info on the [about](/about/) page.

As I have come to realize, a chronicle of how one spends time is, in the long run, invaluable.
